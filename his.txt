- create a project by create-react-app
- apply flow by `yarn add --dev flow-bin` and create a .flowconfig by `yarn run flow init`
- apply airbnb eslint
  `yarn add eslint-config-airbnb-base`, `eslint --init`, and then delete the .eslint.rc file
- change the package.json file
- `yarn add eslint` and `eslint--init`

but `create-react-app` project is many unfamilar with airbnb, so make disalbe `registerServiceWorker`.js that is for PWA.
also i like the rule what if no state, we have to use functional component.
